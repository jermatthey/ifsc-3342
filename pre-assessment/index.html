    <h2>My Assessment</h2>
    <!--Hey Thomas!-->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <img src="assets/resources/content-image2.jpg" alt="Thomas's funny meme"/>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>The "alt" attribute describes an image and is used by screen readers.  It also appears when an image won't load.  The "title" attribute is the text that appears when the user hovers over a link or image</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>

      <dl>
        <dt>Term</dt> 
        <dd>Description</dd>
      </dl>
  <br />
    <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
